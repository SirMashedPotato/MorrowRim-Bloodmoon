	<description>Adds in the bloodmoon event and Hircine storyteller. The bloodmoon event will occur on a consistent cycle if Hircine is the current storyteller. You can enable the bloodmoon event for all storytellers in the mod settings menu. The overall difficulty can also be modified there.\n\nAvatars of Hircine may appear during a bloodmoon. Hunting these will allow you to bestow permanent gifts to your brave hunters. Of course, during a bloodmoon you will not be the only hunter. Werewolf hunting groups will periodically spawn, their only task is to hunt down all living colonists. Attacks from these dangerous beasts may inflict sanies lupinus, a rare disease that seems almost harmless. If left long enough the disease will transition into dormant lycanthropy, which will be activated at the start of the next bloodmoon, permanently turning the pawn into a rabid werewolf. \n\n-Supports Vanilla Achievements Expanded.\n-Faction control or Vanilla Expanded Framework is required if added to an existing game.\n-Based on the game by Bethesda Game Studios: 'The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind'\n\n-Big thanks to the testers on the ESCP Discord, and everyone who has left feedback on the Steam Workshop page!
